# Governance overview

Governance plays a crucial role in CI/CD tools, particularly for anyone operating in regulated industries or handling sensitive data. It encompasses policies, processes, and controls to ensure practices align with the following:

- Industry-specific regulations.
- Internal policies.
- Widely recognized compliance standards.

These standards assess the security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of information systems.
