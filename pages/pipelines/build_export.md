# Export build data

Each [Buildkite plan](https://buildkite.com/pricing) has a maximum build retention
period, after which your oldest builds are automatically deleted.

> ðŸ“˜ Enterprise feature
> Build export is only available on an [Enterprise](https://buildkite.com/pricing) plan.

If you need to retain build data beyond the retention period in your [Buildkite plan](https://buildkite.com/pricing), you can have Buildkite export the data to a private Amazon S3 bucket. Prior to old build data being removed, Buildkite exports JSON representations of the builds to the S3 bucket you provide.

## Preparing your S3 bucket

- Read and understand [Security best practices for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/security-best-practices.html).
- Your bucket must be located in Amazon's `us-east-1` region.
- Your bucket must have a policy allowing cross-account access as described here and demonstrated in the example belowÂ¹.
    - Allow Buildkite's AWS account `032379705303` to `s3:GetBucketLocation`.
    - Allow Buildkite's AWS account `032379705303` to `s3:PutObject` keys matching `buildkite/build-exports/org=YOUR-BUILDKITE-ORGANIZATION-UUID/*`.
    - Do *not* allow AWS account `032379705303` to `s3:PutObject` keys outside that prefix.
- Your bucket should use modern S3 security features and configurations, for example (but not limited to):
    - [Block public access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html) to prevent accidental misconfiguration leading to data exposure.
    - [ACLs disabled with bucket owner enforced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html) to ensure your AWS account owns the objects written by Buildkite.
    - [Server-side data encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html) (`SSE-S3` is enabled by default but you may want to consider `SSE-KMS`).
    - [S3 Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html) to help recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite.
- You may want to use [Amazon S3 Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) to manage storage class and object expiry.

Â¹ Your S3 bucket policy should look like this, with `YOUR-BUCKET-NAME-HERE` and
`YOUR-BUILDKITE-ORGANIZATION-UUID` substituted with your details:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "BuildkiteGetBucketLocation",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn\:aws\:iam::032379705303:root"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetBucketLocation",
            "Resource": "arn\:aws\:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME-HERE"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "BuildkitePutObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn\:aws\:iam::032379705303:root"
            },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn\:aws\:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME-HERE/buildkite/build-exports/org=YOUR-BUILDKITE-ORGANIZATION-UUID/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Your Buildkite Organization ID (UUID) can be found on the settings page described in the next section.

## Enabling build exports

To enable build exports:

1. Navigate to your [organization's pipeline settings](https://buildkite.com/organizations/~/pipeline-settings).
1. In the _Export Build Data to S3_ section, enter your Amazon S3 bucket name to use.
1. Select _Enable Export_.
