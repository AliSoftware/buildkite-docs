# Pipeline tags

You can now tag your pipelines and search for them through the search bar. Tags are beneficial when you have many pipelines and would like to group them so you can filter through them quickly.

Tags are unique per pipeline. You can only add the same tag once. Tags are limited to five per pipeline, and are no longer than 64 chars. Tag names support emoji and text.

Tags are available through Pipeline Settings and the APIs; you can set it through the tags property in Pipelines Rest API or under pipeline types through GraphQL API.
