# Bitbucket

Buildkite integrates with [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) to provide automated builds based on your source control. You can run a build every time you push code to Bitbucket, and pull requests can have their build status live-updated as builds progress.

This guide shows you how to set up your Bitbucket builds with Buildkite.

## Set up the Bitbucket webhook

Once you've created a pipeline in Buildkite and copied in your Bitbucket repository URL, Buildkite shows you setup instructions for configuring your Bitbucket webhooks.

You can also find these instructions by following the _Bitbucket Setup Instructions_ link on your Buildkite pipeline's _Settings_ page:

The setup instructions give you:

- A direct link to your Bitbucket repository's _Webhooks_ settings
- Instructions
- A custom webhook URL for the pipeline

Once you've followed the link you can add a new webhook:

After filling out the webhook details using the instructions from your Buildkite pipeline settings, select _Save_, and you're ready to trigger a build.

## Enable commit status updates

If you want your Bitbucket pull request's build status icons to update as builds progress, you need to connect your Bitbucket account with Buildkite. You only need to do this once, and if you don't need build status updates you can skip this step altogether.

To connect your Bitbucket account:

1. Open Buildkite's _Personal Settings_.
2. Choose _Connected Apps_.
3. Select _Connect_ next to _Bitbucket_.

Buildkite prompts you to give permission for Buildkite to post status updates, then redirects back to your _Connected Apps_ page.

## Mercurial support

Buildkite Agent's default source control tool is Git, and doesn't support [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org) out of the box. If you want to use
Buildkite with a Bitbucket Mercurial repository, you must supply your own
Mercurial checkout code using a [`checkout` hook](/docs/agent/v3/hooks#job-lifecycle-hooks).
