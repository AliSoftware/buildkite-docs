# PagerDuty

The [PagerDuty](http://pagerduty.com/) integration in Buildkite can send [change events](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/change-events) to PagerDuty when your builds finish.

## Generating a PagerDuty integration API key

Before using the integration you'll need to generate a PagerDuty Integration API Key.

In [PagerDuty](http://pagerduty.com/), go to the "Service Directory":

Then choose the service you'd like Buildkite to send change events to:

Navigate to the "Integrations" tab and choose "Add a new integration"

Under "Integration Name", choose a memorable name for this integration. A good example could be the name of the Buildkite pipeline you intend to add this integration to.

For "Integration Type", choose "Buildkite".

Once you've filled out this form, select "Add Integration".

Copy the "Integration Key" from your Integrations list and  use it in [Sending change events from your pipeline](#sending-change-events-from-your-pipeline).

## Sending change events from your pipeline

By default, after you've added an Integration API Key, Buildkite will send PagerDuty a Change Event every build regardless of whether the build passed or failed.

Add the PagerDuty [Integration API Key](#generating-a-pagerduty-integration-api-key) to the [`notify` attribute](/docs/pipelines/notifications) of your build configuration.

Make sure that you're using a secure secrets management solution to handle the PagerDuty Integration key, and never commit it in plaintext to source control in a YAML file. See [Managing pipeline secrets](/docs/pipelines/secrets) for more information on safely handling secrets within your infrastructure.

```yaml
steps:
  - command: "tests.sh"
  - wait
  - command: "deploy.sh"

notify:
  - pagerduty_change_event: "${PAGER_DUTY_API_KEY}"
```
{: codeblock-file="pipeline.yml"}

To send change events only when the build passes, add a [condition](/docs/pipelines/conditionals) to your build configuration:

```yaml
notify:
  - pagerduty_change_event: "${PAGER_DUTY_API_KEY}"
    if: "build.state == 'passed'"
```
