If you want to integrate the same repository to multiple organisations, you need to link each organisation to Github using different Buildkite user accounts. A single Buildkite user can only be linked to a single GitHub user, and that Buildkite user's linked GitHub account should have admin permissions on the intended GitHub organization. If that is not the case, another Buildkite user (with the proper permissions) should install the integration. Each Github App can only be installed once per Github org.
